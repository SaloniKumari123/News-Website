			       As the Indian team works on getting the batting order right for the 2019 World Cup, legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar feels India's usual No. 5, MS Dhoni, should be batting at the same spot in England.Lately, India's number 4 has become a musical chair affair with a couple of batsmen being tried at the spot. With an endless debate on the best suited player for three down, India vice-captain Rohit Sharma had suggested that MS Dhoni should be moved promoted to play at No. 4."My personal opinion is Dhoni should be batting five. I still don't know what the team combination would be, but if you are going Rohit and Shikhar as openers, to Virat [Kohli] at No. 3 and whoever at No. 4 then Dhoni could be No. 5. Then Hardik Pandya, an explosive player, follows them," Sachin Tendulkar told in an interview to ESPNcricinfo."That way the experienced batsmen are well spaced out and Dhoni can stretch the game towards the end where he himself can be explosive along with Hardik," Tendulkar said.

			      Prime Minister Theresa May set out on Tuesday a "new deal" for Britain's departure from the European Union, offering sweeteners to opposition parties in her fourth attempt to break an impasse in parliament over Brexit.Three years since Britain voted to leave the EU and almost two months after the planned departure date, May is mounting a last bid to try to get the deeply divided parliament's backing for a divorce deal, to leave the office with some kind of legacy.The odds do not look good. Despite offering what she described as "significant further changes", many lawmakers, hardened in their positions, have already decided not to vote next month for the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, legislation which implements the terms of Britain's departure.Speaking at the headquarters of PricewaterhouseCoopers, May appealed to lawmakers to get behind her deal, offering the prospect of a possible second referendum on the agreement and closer trading arrangements with the EU as incentives."I say with conviction to every MP or every party: I have compromised, now I ask you to compromise," she said......<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/britain-s-theresa-may-offers-new-deal-to-try-to-break-brexit-deadlock-1531420-2019-05-21">Read More</a>

			       US President Donald Trump warned on Monday Iran would be met with "great force" if it attacked US interests in the Middle East, and government sources said Washington strongly suspects Shi'ite militias with ties to Tehran were behind a rocket attack in Baghdad's Green Zone."I think Iran would be making a very big mistake if they did anything," Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Monday evening for an event in Pennsylvania. "If they do something, it will be met with great force but we have no indication that they will."His comments came as two US government sources said the United States strongly suspects Shi'ite militias with ties to, and possibly encouragement from, Iran fired a rocket on Sunday into Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone.The sources, who are familiar with US national security assessments and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States was still trying to establish which militia fired the Katyusha rocket on Sunday and the extent, if any, of Iranian involvement.....<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/donald-trump-warns-iran-of-its-official-end-if-us-threatened-again-1530675-2019-05-21">Read more</a>
