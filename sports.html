  <h3><b>ICC World Cup 2019: Tom Latham blow to New Zealand ahead of India warm-up game</b></h3>
  <div class="para">
  <p>
    <b>New Zealand wicket-keeper batsman Tom Latham will miss the two warm-up matches against India and West Indies on May 25 and 28, respectively, due to injury.Uncapped back-up Tom Blundell is set to keep the wickets.“Tom won’t be available for the first two warm-up games. We are hoping he progresses nice and quickly and we will have to address it as the days go by,” ICC quoted Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson, as saying on Thursday, while confirming the news at the Captains’ Day in London.The gloveman sustained an injury to his finger during a match against Australia XI, before flying to the UK for the round-robin format World Cup. Initially, it was understood that Latham would play in the second warm-up, however, now he has been ruled out of the warm-up against West Indies as well.</b>

  <p><b>Moreover, it is not clear whether Latham will be fit for New Zealand’s opening World Cup match against Sri Lanka on June 1, ICC reported.Williamson also said that he is pleased to have the New Zealand squad back together as the team last played an ODI against Bangladesh in February.“It’s been great get together for the last few days. We’ve not played together for a couple of months but we’re not the only ones in that boat. The guys are excited to be back in the camp which is really refreshing, and we’re looking forward to the challenges that we have got coming up,” the skipper said.

  <h4><b>ICC World Cup 2019: Mark Waugh picks top three batsmen, includes one Indian</b></h4></p>
  <p><b>
    Former Australia batsman Mark Waugh, on Friday picked Virat Kohli, Jos Buttler, and David Warner as his top three batsmen for the upcoming ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup.“Definitely Virat Kohli. He’s No.1,” cricket.com.au quoted Waugh as saying.Kohli is widely regarded as the greatest ODI player of all time, with 41 centuries at an average of 59.57. The Indian skipper is currently ranked at number one position in the ICC ODI batsmen rankings.Moving over to England’s wicket-keeper batsman Buttler, Waugh said he would have the player at number two in his top three.“Jos Buttler, I’d have him at No.2 in the top three,” Waugh said.Buttler has been in exceptional form of late, smashing a 50-ball century in the recently concluded ODI series against Pakistan. He even scored a knock of 150 runs off just 77 balls against West Indies earlier this year.</b>
